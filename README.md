# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and factors affecting restaurant ratings and success. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to understand the distribution of restaurants across cities, cuisine popularity, pricing, and rating patterns.

## Objectives
- Analyze the restaurant landscape based on various features like location, cuisine type, ratings, and pricing.
- Identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and patterns.

## Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Location**: City or region where the restaurant is located.
- **Cuisines**: Types of cuisines offered by the restaurant.
- **Average Cost for Two**: Estimated cost for two people dining at the restaurant.
- **Currency**: Currency in which the prices are quoted.
- **Rating**: Customer rating of the restaurant.
- **Votes**: Number of customer votes for the restaurant.
- **Has Online Delivery**: Whether the restaurant provides online food delivery.
- **Has Table Booking**: Whether the restaurant provides table booking.
- **Price Range**: Price range category of the restaurant.

## Project Structure
- **Zomato_data-analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, EDA, and machine learning modeling.
- **Data**: The dataset used for the analysis, which includes restaurant information like cuisines, ratings, location, and more.
- **Plots**: Visualizations generated during the analysis phase to help understand trends and patterns.

## Key Analysis Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution of restaurants across different cities.
   - Popular cuisines and their distribution.
   - Relationship between price range and restaurant ratings.
   - Impact of online delivery and table booking on restaurant success.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Converting categorical features to numerical values.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Results and Insights
- The analysis reveals that customer ratings are significantly influenced by the price range, cuisine type, and whether the restaurant offers online delivery.
- Cities like Delhi and Bangalore have a higher concentration of top-rated restaurants.
- Restaurants offering table booking generally have higher customer satisfaction.

## Future Work
- Explore additional machine learning models for better rating prediction accuracy.
- Extend the analysis to include sentiment analysis from customer reviews.
- Analyze the effect of external factors such as weather, holidays, and events on restaurant performance.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the restaurant industry and helps identify factors that influence restaurant ratings. It can be useful for restaurant owners, food delivery platforms, and customers to make informed decisions.
